## Overview

The Udacity Car Simulator is a tool used for developing and testing self-driving car algorithms. This repository includes the necessary data to build and test a model that can control a car in the simulator environment. 

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of several components:
- **Images**: Sequential images from the car's front-facing camera.
- **Steering Angles**: Corresponding steering angles for each image.
- **Metadata**: Additional metadata such as throttle, brake, and speed.
